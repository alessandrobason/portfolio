**-- How to run --**
Simply run server.exe and select how many players you want to play with, then open that many client.exe, click play and enter the ip that's written on the server as "local ip"

**-- Controls --**
Arrows to move, z to place a bomb, p to turn on/off pixel perfect mode

**-- How to play --**
Use the bombs to destroy the crates, sometime they drop powerups (fire means the bomb radius will be bigger by 1, skates means that the player will go faster, bomb means that the player can place another bomb). The objective is to kill the other players with the bombs.
